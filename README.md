# An unofficial LaTeX-beamer poster theme for UCLA

Wu Sun

To use the template, make a copy of `example.tex` and start modifying it.

```shell
$ cp example.tex my-poster.tex
```

Use `\begin{columns}[t] ... \end{columns}` to divide the canvas into multiple
columns.

You can customize the footer text in `beamerthemeucla.sty`.

## Requirement

This template requires the `beamerposter` package to be installed in your TeX
distribution.
